1.Stock Price Rise

Given stock prices over time, for each price find the next price that is higher.
If no such future price is higher, return -1.


2.A customer’s VM usage is recorded as billing entries. Each entry tells when the machine started, when it stopped, and the cost per minute for that time.
You must calculate the total cost.
If any log has invalid times (end < start), ignore it.
You are given this class:
class BillingEntry {
    int start; 
    int end;
    double costPerMin;
}
Write a function to compute the total cost.
Input

Customer has 2 logs:

Log	Start	End	Cost per Min
1	10	20	2.0
2	30	40	1.5
Working

Log 1 → duration = 20–10 = 10 mins → cost = 10 × 2.0 = 20

Log 2 → duration = 40–30 = 10 mins → cost = 10 × 1.5 = 15

Output
Total Cost = 35.0


3.You are building a smart parking management system. Each car entering the parking lot is logged with:

entryTime (in minutes from the start of the day)

exitTime (in minutes from the start of the day)

Your program must:

Calculate the peak occupancy (maximum number of cars in the parking lot at the same time).

Calculate the parking cost for each car:

First 2 hours: $5 per hour

After 2 hours: $3 per hour for remaining duration

Notes:

Ignore invalid entries where exitTime < entryTime.

Duration is calculated as (exitTime - entryTime) in minutes and converted to hours.

Round costs to 2 decimal places.

0 120
30 150
60 180


Peak Occupancy: 3
Car 1 Parking Cost: $10.00
Car 2 Parking Cost: $10.00
Car 3 Parking Cost: $10.00


Explanation:

Timeline occupancy:

0 → 1, 30 → 2, 60 → 3 (peak), 120 → 2, 150 → 1, 180 → 0

Each car parked for 120 min (2 hours) → $5 × 2 = $10

4.
A company tracks the working shifts of employees. Each shift has a start time and end time (in hours, 24-hour format).

Sometimes, employee shifts overlap. To calculate total working periods, you need to find consolidated continuous working intervals.

Task:

Combine overlapping shifts into continuous working intervals.

Return the list of consolidated intervals, sorted by start time.

Notes:

If endTime < startTime, consider the entry invalid and ignore it.

Assume times are integers in [0, 24].
