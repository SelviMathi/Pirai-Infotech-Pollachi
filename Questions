1.Stock Price Rise

Given stock prices over time, for each price find the next price that is higher.
If no such future price is higher, return -1.


2.A customer’s VM usage is recorded as billing entries. Each entry tells when the machine started, when it stopped, and the cost per minute for that time.
You must calculate the total cost.
If any log has invalid times (end < start), ignore it.
You are given this class:
class BillingEntry {
    int start; 
    int end;
    double costPerMin;
}
Write a function to compute the total cost.
Input

Customer has 2 logs:

Log	Start	End	Cost per Min
1	10	20	2.0
2	30	40	1.5
Working

Log 1 → duration = 20–10 = 10 mins → cost = 10 × 2.0 = 20

Log 2 → duration = 40–30 = 10 mins → cost = 10 × 1.5 = 15

Output
Total Cost = 35.0
